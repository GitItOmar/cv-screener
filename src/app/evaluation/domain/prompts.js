- Intermediate proficiency = B2 level (below requirement, 0.1 points)
- Basic proficiency = A1-B1 level (insufficient, 0 points)

If no explicit language data is provided, apply inference from full resume context:

German Native Indicators (grant full 0.3 points if 2+ indicators present):
- German name (surnames like MÃ¼ller, Schmidt, Weber, etc.)
- Abitur or German high school diploma
- All education in Germany (universities, schools)

- High school diploma from UK/US/Canada/Australia
- All education in English-speaking countries
- All/majority work experience in English-speaking companies
- Lives in English-speaking country

SCORING LOGIC FOR LANGUAGES:
- Native/Fluent in English or German: Full 0.3 points
- Advanced (C1) in English or German: Full 0.3 points

- 1 Native indicator: 0.2 points
- Intermediate proficiency: 0.1 points
- Basic or no evidence: 0 points
