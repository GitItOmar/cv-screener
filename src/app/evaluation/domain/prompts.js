Score 0-1 points considering:
- Contact completeness (name, email, phone) (0.4 points)
- Location alignment with DACH region (0.3 points)
- Language proficiency evidence (C1 English/German) (0.3 points)

LANGUAGE PROFICIENCY EVALUATION:
Look for explicit evidence first:
- Explicit proficiency statements
- Language certifications
- International experience requiring language skills

NATIVE LANGUAGE INFERENCE:
If no explicit evidence is found, apply sophisticated inference for native speakers:

German Native Indicators (grant full 0.3 points if 2+ indicators present):
- German name (surnames like MÃ¼ller, Schmidt, Weber, etc.)
- Abitur or German high school diploma
- All education in Germany (universities, schools)
- All/majority work experience in German companies
- Lives in Germany with German address
- Consistent presence in Germany throughout career

English Native Indicators (grant full 0.3 points if 2+ indicators present):
- English/Anglo name combined with education/work in English-speaking countries
- High school diploma from UK/US/Canada/Australia
- All education in English-speaking countries
- All/majority work experience in English-speaking companies
- Lives in English-speaking country

SCORING LOGIC:
- Explicit C1+ evidence: Full 0.3 points
- 2+ Native indicators: Full 0.3 points (native = C2 level, exceeds C1 requirement)
- 1 Native indicator: 0.2 points
- Unclear/insufficient evidence: 0.1 points
